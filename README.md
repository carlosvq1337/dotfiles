A compilation of the various dot configuration files I find useful.

## .vimrc

Vim runtime config file:

To set up vim with this file begin by

1. Delete your existing ~/.vim/ folder and ~/.vimrc file:

```
rm -rf ~/.vim && rm -f ~/.vimrc
```  

2. Download the `.vimrc` file into your home directory:

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carlosvq1337/dotfiles/main/.vimrc -P ~/
```
